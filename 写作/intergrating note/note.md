### 理由段

**As opposed to the writer's idea that** carved stone balls could be hunting weapons, **the professor states that** they lacked signs of wear supposed to apear on weapons. 

**The lecturer advances the theory by saying that** common weapons generally show wear, for instance, having pieces borken off, but the surfaces of carved stone balls did not show wear or damage.

**The professor continues to discredit the writing's assertion that** carved stone balls, uniform in size, could be used to weight and measure, **by examining the fact that** though having same sizes, they were different in masses, making it impossible for them to be standard weights.

**To explain it further, the lecturer points out that** carved stone balls were made of different types of stone, with distinct density; consequently, they, in the uniform sizes, varied in weight and could not be adopted as weighing systems.

**It is the professor's third argument that** some balls' simple patterns and the lack of evidence as possessions indicate that they were not social status markers, **which contradicts the view of the writer that** they, with intricate designs, could mark their social status. 

**To explore deeper, the professor contends that** admittedly, some balls were carved with elaborate designs, but others had markings that were too simple for the balls to be status symbols; moreover, unlike possessions, which people with high ranks were usually buried with,  carved stone balls were not found in tombs or graves, showing that they were not possessions to represent social status.

### 结尾段

An apparent divide exists between the writer and the professor on the professor on the purposes of carve stone balls.
