Personalities, the foundation of one's well-being, have been valued and even trigger a heated dicussion over the attitudes towards failure and success. Success and prosperity, in some people's views, should be valued. Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that remaining optimistic towards failure is more vital, due to the contributions to working efficiency and personal development.

What must be prioritized is that (happy->efficienty), with a pleasant mood towards failure, rather than with a goal achieved, people can enhance their working efficiency, by saving time and reducing risk of errors. Initially, never can we ignore the significance of happiness to saving a quantity of time. 

In detial, the more people are positive in the face of failure, the less people will complain, regret and moan, so that they will devote more time to working our problems and thus enhace their productivity; on the contrary, it is impossible for employees to save time when they indulge themselves in enjoying and savoring success. Moreover, optimism in face of failure, without doubt, will reduce the possibilities of mistakes, enhancing working efficiency. To be more specific, it is optimistic attitude that leads people to be concentrated on accumulating informations, negotiating with clients and writting reports, which decreases errors in the workplaces; how can staff keep focused on work if flattered by success？

What should be equally worth discussing is that when keeping happy towards failure, instead of achieving success, people will promote their personal development, including persistance and independence, To begin with, only by being optimistic can people remain persistent. To explain it further, not only can optimistic people constantly and bravely solve problems, but also they can diligently and positively seek new opportunities, during which they will become more and more perseverant; in constrast, under not circumstances can people nurture such persistence when they only experience success without enigmas. In addition, it is well-known that optimism fosters one's independence. In detail, the happier people are towards failure, the more likely they will seek answers, reflect on their behaviors and seek assistance online by themselves, cultivating their autonomy; contrarily, people will find it impossible to become independent and automomous, since they are immersed in success.



Efficiency, being vital in one's personal life, can be boosted when people are optimistic. Personal development, being significant in one's growth, will be facilitated by people being happy in front of failure. To conclude, only by keeping an optimistic attitude towards can people harvest and reap benefits.
