Heath, the objective everyone strives for, has been valued and even triggers a heated debate among...  



 

What must be prioritized is that ...

First and foremost, doing exercise, rather than changing the amount of stress, will contribute to a strong social relationship with others, by enabling people to make new friends and maintain connection with old ones. **Initially**, it is plenty of (a large quantity of) exercise that  enlarge people's current social circles, **Specifically**, (sport -> new friend) the more frequently people do to gym or go sport, such as practicing Yoga, running or swimming. the more new friends they will encounter, including their coach and other sports amateurs; **on the contrary**,  people will find it difficult to meet new friends when they choose to do stress-relief activities, which are generally done alone. In addition, by exercising not only can people be exposed to new acquaintances, but also they are able to strengthen relationships with old friends. **To be more specific**, during the process of doing exercise, friends can gather together and communicate over techniques of sports,  satisfying memories in daily life and even problems in professional life, leading to/ which leads to + an intimate bond with each other; **in contrast**, [never / under no circumstance/ how ] how could people leave a good impression on their close friends when they complain, or express their negative thoughts in order to release pressure?





The importance of work, the foundation of a qualify life, **has been universally recognized as more than evident, bring to people's attention the debate over** a satisfying working mode. Doing a single task during the workday, **from some people's viewpoints**, can increase employees' delight. I**n opposition to their opinions, my perspective is that it is** enjoyable for employees to do varieties of tasks, because of the benefits to efficiency and the relationship at work.

**what must be prioritized is that** when dealing with different tasks in workplaces, **instead of** a single one, employees will enhance their efficiency, **by** reducing time and decreasing errors. **To begin with**, the more numerous work people cope with, the more time they can save. **In detail,** due to the freshness caused by distinct and new work, workers will not allocate time to kill their time, such as browsing posts on social media, shopping online or playing video games, which boosts their efficiency; **on the contrary**, 
how could people distribute all the working time to dealing with one single task when they experience tediousness and boredom? **In addition**, only under the requirement of accomplishing assorted tasks can employees lower the risks of errors. **Specifically**, with different projects to address, workers will undergo pressure, set higher expectations to themselves and become more concentrated on work, resulting in fewer mistakes; **in contrast**, Never can we ignore that employees handling the same work during their workdays find it less laborious and get distracted frequently due to their assumed expertise, [定从] under which circumstance they will commit more errors.



Equally importantly, a positive relationship in the work field will be established when workers tackle assorted tasks, instead of just one, including that with colleagues and their supervisor. Initially, it is during the process of doing different projects that they can make a strong bond with their coworkers. To be more specific, employees, when coping with diverse tasks, will encounter, interact with and cooperate with those from different departments and enlarge their friend circles; however, never will a person feel delighted if he meets and communicates only with several colleagues in his group and discuss a limited number of topic each days. Additionally, it is well-know that supervisors will appreciate those with skills and expertise in diverse fields. In detail, not only can versatile employees with multiple skills boost sales and maximum profits, but also they will reduce the number of works and lower budgets for his corporation, who thus are more likely to get promoted by their boss; contrarily, with merely limited knowledge or techniques, a employee will not be valued by his executive.

Efficiency, a significant factor at work, will be enhanced under the demand of assorted assignments.

A close connection, an ingredient in a satisfying professional life, can be built when workers are required to do different projects.

To conclude, only by accomplishing different work can workers achieve a satisfying like at work.

Personalities, the foundation of one's well-being, have been valued and even trigger a heated discussion over the attitude towards failure and success. Success and prosperity, in some people's view, should be valued. Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that remaining optimistic towards failure is more vital, duo to the contribution to working efficiency and personal development.

What must be prioritized is that with the a pleasant mood/ with a positive attitude towards failure, rather than with a goal achieved, people can enhance their working efficiency, by saving time and reducing risks of errors.

Education, the foundation of a qualify life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over the importance of online education. Learning in traditional classroom, in some people's view, continues to be an effective way. Contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that the advantage of online education significantly outweigh its drawbacks, due to the contributions to their academic performance and personal development.

**To begin with, it is** online education **that provides** students **with the access to a large quantity of** expertise. **In detail,** on the internet, students can acquire a wide range of knowledge in history, art and science, enlarge their knowledge base; **in contrast, such** a large amount of knowledge **cannot be obtained when they are** instructed by only one teacher in concrete classrooms. 

**In addition, never can we ignore the significance of** distance education **to** student's interesting in learning. **To be more specific, **by receiving education on the internet, students will find it more interesting to deal with mathematical problems, do research, and write proposals; on the other hand, will they be passionate about these tasks when teachers always lectures in brick-and-mortar classrooms?



What should be equally worth discussing is that receiving distance education, rather than having traditional face-to-face course, can promote student's personal development, by honing their interpersonal skills and cultivating their persistence. Initially it is well-acknowledged that educated on internet, students can practice their communication skills. **To explore it deeper**, when attending online course, students can know lots of people easily and get their email or social media accounts which can help students know their classmate's life better; on the contrary, under no circumstances will they interact with such a variety of people if they are educated in traditional classroom settings. Additionally, when having a distance education program, students will be more determined. To explain it further, the more distance-learning course they take on the internet, the more distractions they will be exposed to, stimulating them to resist temptations and foster their persistence; however, it is impossible for them to encounter these lures in traditional classrooms.



​     



Academic performance, the foundation of one's future development, will be boosted when they receive online education.

Personal development, essential contributors to one's future success, will be facilitated, if they are educated on the internet.

To conclude, only by having distance education, instead of being taught in classrooms, can students reap numerous benefits.

 



What must be prioritized is that watching sports TV programs, instead of limiting the time spend in watching, will negatively influence work, by reducing the working time and increasing risks of mistakes. Initially, it is spending to much time in sports programs that lead people to leave little on their works

it is people watching sports programs that will distribute less time to work. In detail,

Moreover never can we ignore that too much time on sports programs will lead to more errors at work. To be more specific, after watching too much sports programs, people tend to recall some exciting moment or interesting video while doing some important work, leading them to distracting 

after watching sports competitions, people will recall the performance of their favorite sports teams, and communicate with colleagues over the programs, who thus will commit numerous errors at work; on the contrary, employees will concentrate on their work when not watching too much TV, since they are more energetic and refreshed at work.

Taking a former employee working in Google as an example, who was addicted to  watching NBA and was finally fired. He once usually spent three hours each day after work in watching the basketball competitions, leaving no time to develop software. Moreover, since he stayed up late at night to watch the sports programs, he could not concentrate on work the next day, frequently making mistakes and recalling his favorite sports star.

Work, an essential part of life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over the techniques of leadership. Not involving employees in decision-making process, in some people's views, is effective. Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that it is crucial for leaders to get employees engaged in deciding, duo to the contributions to workers and executives.

What must be most prioritized is that (decision -> employees) by encouraging employees to make decisions, rather than denying such an access, a supervisor will place workers as beneficiaries, by making them work more efficient and diligently. Initially,(decision-> efficient) never can we ignore that the importance of involvement in making decisions to working efficiency. In detail, when everyone in a group is a part of the decision-making, each person can contribute ideas, knowledge, and experience, which enhances the overall productivity; however, the efficiency will be lowered, when the leader himself makes the final decision without other's engagement as he needs to search information by himself via his limited knowledges.

(decision->diligent )

Moreover, with more people's engagement, employees will be more diligent and motivated. To be more specific, the more employees are allowed to make decision, the more diligent they are in doing researching, writing reports and carrying out determinations; in contrast, they will be less focused and concentrated on their job if they are blocked from the making decisions since they feel less valued and cherished.

What should be equally worth discussion is that  by making other as part of the decision-making process, rather than expelling them,  executives will obtain more benefits, by building a strong relationship and gaining more relaxation. To begin with(decision->relation) only through stimulating employees to make decisions can a leader establish a close bond with them. 



Specifically, (decision->relationship)when inviting the colleague and subordinates into discussion, supervisors tend to know their opinion, suggestion, and demanding as a result, staffs can know the difficult of the projects, leading each part to understand each other; on the contrary, there are too much misleading between bosses and works, if works just listen the bosses command.

Specifically, during the process of reaching decisions together, the executive will provide chances to communicate, and show respect and trust to their subordinates, which will profoundly improve the relationship among the workers in the company; contrarily, it is impossible for supervisors to close their employees when workers are not permitted to reach decisions collectively. In addition the more employees are involved in decision-making process, the more relaxed a leader will be. To explain it further, when participating in the process of reaching decisions, employees can assist their boss in doing cost-benefit analysis, writing proposals and assuming responsibilities, which effectively reduces work burdens of the leader; however, a supervisor is supposed to undertake more workloads, when he make decisions on his own.

Employees, being essential to a company, will reap benefits when their leader engages them in making decisions. Supervisors, being core at work, will become beneficiaries if they invite their subordinates in decision-making process. To conclude, only when employees are engages in reaching decisions can a company maximize its benefits.





What should be equally worth discussing is that involving everyone into decision, rather than making decision by a  leader, is conductive to supervisors by enhance their relationship with his  and make them more relax.
