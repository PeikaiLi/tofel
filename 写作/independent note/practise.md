Working, an essential part of life, has been valued and even triggered a  heated discussion over the techniques of leadership. Not involving employees in decision-making process, in some people's view. is effective, Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that it is crucial for leaders to get employees engaged in deciding, due to the contributions to workers and executives.

what must be prioritized is that by encouraging employees to make decisions, rather than denying such an access, a supervisor will place workers as beneficiaries, by making them work efficiently and diligently. Initially, never can we ignore the importance of involvement in making decisions to working efficiency.  In detail, when everyone in a group is a  part of the decision-making process, each person can contribute ideas, knowledge, and experience, which enhances the overall productivity; however, efficiency will be lowered, when the leader himself makes the final decision without others' engagement and he needs to search for information by himself. Moreover, with more people's engagement, employees will be more diligent and motivated. To be more specific, the more employees are allowed to make decisions, the more diligent they are in doing researching, writing reports and carrying out determinations; in contrast, employees will be less focused and concentrated on their work, if they are blocked from making decisions since they feel less valued and cherished. 

What should be equally discussed is that by making others as part of the decision-making process, rather than expelling them, executives will obtain more benefits, by building a strong relationship and gaining more relaxation. To begin with, only through stimulating employees to making decisions can a leader establish a close bond with them. Specifically, during the process of reaching decisions together, the executives  can provide a great chances to communicate, show enough respect and trust to their subordinates, which will profoundly improve the relationship among workers; contrarily, it is impossible for supervisors to be close their employees when workers are not permitted to reach decisions collectively. In addition, the more employees are involved in decision-making process, the more relaxed a leader will be. To explain it further, when participating in the process of reaching decisions, employees can assist their boss in doing cost-benefit analysis, writing proposals and assuming responsibilities, which effectively reduces work burdens of the leader; however, a supervisor is supposed to undertake more workloads, when he make the decisions on his own.

Employees, being essential to a company, will reap benefits when their leader engages them in making decisions. Supervisors, being core at work, will become beneficiaries if they invite subordinates in decision-making process. To conclude. only when employees are engaged in reaching decision can company maximize its benefits

Place for living, the foundation of people's life, has been valued and even triggered a heated discussion over the necessity of place for living. Living in an area that is not expensive or that is close to relatives, in some people's views, is conductive to their life. Contrary to those people's opinions is my perspective is that the advantages of living in an area with shops and restaurant significantly outweigh others, due to the contribution to health and relationship.

What must be prioritized is that living near the commercial center, rather than the rural, people are easy to enjoy a heathy life, including mental health and physical health.

Initially, it is living close to business circles that can be beneficial to people's mental health. To be more specific,when people are living around supermarket, it is very convenient for them to buy whatever they need, such as food, drinks and clothes, leading them to have a more comfortable life; on the contrary, people will find it difficult to get some goods which is necessity of life.

In addition, never can we ignore the significant of living beside the market to physical heath. To explore it deeper, the closer they live to the business circles, the more chance they have to find a gym, making them to do more exercise with professional tutor and having a strong body; how could people find those professional tutor if they live far away from the city?

What should be equally worth discussing is that with people living near the restaurant, it is conductive to their relationship by getting to know the new friends and maintaining the relation with old ones.

To begin with, it is a well acknowledged truth that the people living near the shopping center are more likely to make new friends. In detail, while living beside the shopping mall, people can meet all kinds of people, such as the students, the teachers and the business man, which means they are possible to meet someone share the same interesting and willing to be their friends; however, under no circumstance can they have the access to know so many kinds of people, and not to mention to become friends.

Moreover, only with living near the restaurant can people treat their old friends very often. To explain it further, when people are living in an area where there are lots of restaurant are available, they are more easy to invite their friends to have a dinner and to watch a movie; on the other hand, it is very difficult for people to book a dinner or find a place to relax, if they live in suburb.

Not only can people have a heathier life, but also they can maintain their friendship with others, when they are living near the shops and restaurants. In a nutshell, only by living in an area with such kind of facility can people reap maximum benefits. 



It is exercise that improves student's physical health.

Only when doing exercise can people prompt their physical health.
